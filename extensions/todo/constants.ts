Tasks are short, outcome-oriented units (imperative subjects, reviewable scope) with pending/in_progress/completed status and optional blockedBy dependencies (validated, cycle-checked). Keep exactly one task in_progress: mark it before starting work, and mark it completed only when implementation and verification are genuinely done — never with failing tests or partial work; reopen a task instead of duplicating it. Use for work with three or more meaningful steps or user-provided task lists; skip it for trivial single-step tasks and simple Q&A.";
